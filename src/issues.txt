1. Make num_objects in prepare_data.py count the number of object folders rather than assume 5
2. Investigate how the weights are being loaded in in_resnet.py
3. Pop off more layers of Inception ResNet
4. Use Tensorflow's Keras instead of just Keras
5. Tensorboard to in_resnet.py
6. Add dropout
7. If the novel images passed to classify.py are above a certain percentage accuracy, add
      them to the main dataset.
