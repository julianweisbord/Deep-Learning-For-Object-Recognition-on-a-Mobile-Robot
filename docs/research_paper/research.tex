\section{Introduction}
Our project is research oriented, meaning we spent time experimenting and investigating different technologies and techniques. Our software pipeline has several major programs that interact with each other to collect and process of our data. For each of these steps we looked into alternative solutions to the problem, and analyzed details such cost benefit analyses and the potential to scale technologies as the classification model grows. 
   
\section{Areas of Research}
While the main goal of our project was to create a fully functional software pipeline, we incorporated research into every component of the pipeline. The problem of sequential online learning is not solved by one perfect algorithm or software library
